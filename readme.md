Do It is a very basic app people can use to create a to do list in order to manage their lives better. People can mark certain tasks as important or non-important so taht the more urgent tasks will be marked and pushed to the top of the list.

The purpose of building this app is for me to learn/get a better understanding of iOS development. This is a very basic build and I plan to make branches in order to experiment with adding new features.
